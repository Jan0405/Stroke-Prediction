# Stroke-Prediction

Stroke is a serious medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, leading to brain damage and potential long-term disability or death. The risk of stroke is affected by a wide range of factors, including age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, obesity, and smoking.

Detecting a stroke in its early stages brings numerous advantages, including timely medical intervention, reduced brain damage, prevention of long-term disabilities, identification of underlying causes, and the facilitation of swift medical decision-making to optimize patient outcomes.

For this project, our objective is to create a machine learning model for early stroke detection, focusing on various causative factors. This model aims to assist clinical teams in predicting or assessing the risk of stroke occurrence, enabling timely medical intervention, minimizing brain damage, preventing long-term disabilities, identifying underlying causes, and facilitating quick medical decision-making to optimize patient outcomes.
